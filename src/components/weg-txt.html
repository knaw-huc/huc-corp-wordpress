<p>The Humanities are increasingly becoming a Data Science. A large-scale digital research infrastructure is needed to provide for the right conditions for research. The KNAW Humanities Cluster plays a pioneering role in major national infrastructure projects such as <a href="https://socialhistory.org/en/hsn/index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HSN</a>, <a href="https://www.clarin.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CLARIN</a>, <a href="https://www.clio-infra.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clio Infra</a>, <a href="https://www.nederlab.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nederlab</a> and <a href="https://www.clariah.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CLARIAH</a>, in which the European infrastructures CLARIN and DARIAH are brought together. This is possible thanks to the unique situation at the KNAW Humanities Cluster where the largest department Digital Infrastructure in Europe closely works together with researchers and data managers.<br>
In May 2018 it was announced that NWO will enable to continue CLARIAH over the next five years as part of the National Roadmap Infrastructure programs. Together with our partners, we are building a national infrastructure for data science, which is applied by humanities researchers at virtually all Dutch universities and abroad.<br>
To this end, the Digital Infrastructure department develops and manages (advanced) products and services for research and (data) collections and promotes innovative research and collection management by offering expertise to researchers and collection specialists of the KNAW Humanities Cluster and elsewhere.<br>
This department will be able to create and maintain a digital infrastructure that is both innovative and durable, with products and services that meet the wishes of HuC researchers and collection specialists and also form highly valued components in national and international research infrastructures.</p>
